It was developed in 2018 by researchers at Google AI Language and serves as a swiss army knife solution to 11+ of the most common language tasks, such as sentiment analysis and named entity recognition.\n","\n","Language has historically been difficult for computers to ‘understand’. Sure, computers can collect, store, and read text inputs but they lack basic language context.\n","\n","So, along came Natural Language Processing (NLP): the field of artificial intelligence aiming for computers to read, analyze, interpret and derive meaning from text and spoken words. This practice combines linguistics, statistics, and Machine Learning to assist computers in ‘understanding’ human language.\n","\n","Individual NLP tasks have traditionally been solved by individual models created for each specific task. That is, until— BERT!\n","\n","BERT revolutionized the NLP space by solving for 11+ of the most common NLP tasks (and better than previous models) making it the jack of all NLP trades."],"metadata":{"id":"puarzvrEkw1w"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a neural network architecture that uses the Transformer architecture to pre-train deep bidirectional representations of text. The architecture consists of two parts:\n","\n","Pre-training: BERT is first trained on a large corpus of unlabeled text using two pre-training objectives: Masked Language Modeling (MLM) and Next Sentence Prediction (NSP).\n","\n","Fine-tuning: After pre-training, the BERT model is fine-tuned on a downstream task, such as text classification, question answering, or named entity recognition.\n","\n","The BERT architecture consists of multiple layers of Transformer encoders, with each layer having a multi-head attention mechanism and a feedforward network. The architecture can be configured with different numbers of layers and hidden units depending on the specific task at hand.\n","\n","**Here is the high-level architecture of BERT:**\n","\n","**Input embeddings**: Word embeddings are fed into the model as input, along with a positional encoding that indicates the position of each token in the sequence.\n","\n","**Encoder**: The input embeddings are passed through multiple layers of Transformer encoders. Each encoder layer has two sub-layers: a multi-head attention mechanism and a feedforward network.\n","\n","**Multi-Head Attention**: The multi-head attention mechanism computes attention scores between each pair of tokens in the sequence, allowing the model to capture the relationships between all tokens in the sequence. This is done using multiple attention heads, each of which learns to attend to different parts of the input sequence.\n","\n","**Feedforward Network**: The output of the multi-head attention mechanism is passed through a feedforward network, which applies a non-linear activation function and produces a new representation of the input.\n","\n","**Output Layer**: The final output layer takes the output from the last encoder layer and produces a prediction for the downstream task.\n","\n","Overall, BERT is a powerful architecture that has achieved state-of-the-art results on a wide range of natural language processing tasks.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_kd8-Nzol8ny"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### install KTRAIN
